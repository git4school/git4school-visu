easier to switch to local database storage later\n\n\n\nConfiguration page\n\nA repository that does not have a TP group specified either in the application or in the ReadMe retrieved from Github is now assigned to a default group\n\nOverview graph\n\nWhen creating a milestone, it is now possible not to assign any TP group to it so that it affects all repositories\n\nFixed\n\nA bug that caused the application to load infinitely and block navigation when all the repositories had been deleted\n\n1.1.0\nAdded\nProject\n\nContinuous integration and deployment of technical and user documentation\nAdditionnal documention section in technical document helping potential contributors to understand how the application is designed\n\n\nContinuous deployment of the application on push on master branch\nA clean ReadMe for the project\nThe template for the ReadMe to be read by the application is now in README.template.md\n\n\nWe now use Codacy to track code quality and potential security breaches\nWe now work by sprint of 2 weeks represented by milestones on Github\nWe now use Gitmoji as a standard for the commits\n\nGeneral\n\nJS docs for a good part of the code\n\nHome page\n\nUser guide\nLocalized\nWill be moved little by little to a website dedicated to the user documentation\n\n\n\nGraph pages\n\nButton to reload data from Github on all graph pages\n\nConfiguration page\n\nA page allowing to edit and add through an interface metadata, repositories and sessions\nAbility to edit / add a single repository at a time\nForm validation checking if the repository has already been added and if the user has access to the existing repository\n\n\nAbility to add several repositories from a list of displayed repositories from the authenticated user\nA TP group can be indicated to add a set of repositories with the same TP group\nAlready added repositories are already checked in the list\nLazy loading scrolling to load sets of 100 repositories\nRepositories list sorted by creation date\n\n\nErrors about repositories fetching are now indicated per repository in the configuration page\nAbility to edit / add sessions\nForm validation checking if the end date is later than the start date\nDate pickers localized\n\n\n\n\n\nModified\nGeneral\n\nLocalization updated\nThe accepted format of the dates in the configuration file is more flexible\naccepting 2019-4-2 7:45 and 2019-04-02 07:45\n\n\nUpdated to Angular 9\nName and TP group are now recognized according to the current application language\nComplete refactor for commitService for a better management and scalability\nQuestion recognition is now searching for a (Github) closing keyword and then the question\n\nGraphs\n\nAll graph components now inherit the same base component to factorize the code and allow potential future integration of new graphs\nCommits closing a question without milestone associated are now displayed in green\n\nOverview graph\n\nIt is now possible to upload 2 times in a row the same file\nThis is the only workaround we found for the reread button bug\n\n\n\nQuestions completion graphs\n\nBar index is now saved for the user session\n\nDeleted\nOverview graph\n\nReread button because it was not working and there is no workaround to make it work\n\n1.0.0\nAdded\nGeneral\n\nLocalization (english & french)\nConnection with Github\n\nHome\n\nDocumentation about JSON and ReadMe structure\nDocumentation on the use of the application\nDisplay the CHANGELOG from the Github repository\n\nOverview graph\n\nDisplays the student commits given in the JSON configuration file (they have a different shape and color depending on the associated milestones) \nMove the mouse over a commit to display its details\nClick on a commit to open its Github page in a new tab\n\n\nAdd/edit (or delete) milestones such as reviews, corrections (or others) by clicking on the graph/milestone\nFilter commits and milestones\nBy entering questions in the search bar\nBy selecting a tp group from the drop-down list\n\n\nShow or hide milestones\nChange time scale (the time scale automatically adapts itself according to the most relevant option)\nChange zoom mode (and reset zoom mode) :\nZoom by dragging the mouse\nZoom with the mouse wheel and pan by dragging the mouse\n\n\nUpload and reload the JSON configuration file\nThe application checks that the file is valid JSON file, and sends an error toast otherwise\nThe application checks that the configuration file contains all the required fields and dates in the correct format, and sends an error toast otherwise\n\n\nDownload a compressed file containing :\nThe updated configuration file with the data entered in the application\nA file describing the progress of each student for all questions\nA file listing all students commits and their type (\"Before review\", \"After correction\", ...)\n\n\n\nStudents commits and questions completion graphs\n\nDisplay the

It is more than ever in tune with the time and is becoming an important learning tool. In this context, Jean-Baptiste Raclet and Franck Sylvestre, teacher-researchers at IRIT, are working together on a programming learning protocol. Based on test-driven development, peer reviewing and iterative approach (testing, development, peer reviewing, testing, development, ...), the protocol uses digital tools such as Elaastic and Git4School. To understand the need behind Git4School, it is necessary to detail the \"development\" part of the protocol. In a practice session, a question sheet is given to the students. Then, they develop the features that validate the tests. At the end of each question, the student has to commit his code to his Github repository, with a message identifying the question. After a certain amount of sessions, the teacher will organize a peer review, and then later send the correction to the students. It is therefore important that the teacher is able to follow the progress of the group in order to make reviews and corrections neither too early nor too late. It is to avoid having to visit each repository to get an idea of the group's progression that this project was created.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nYou can find detailed documentation to get started here\n\nGit4School is an application that helps teachers follow the progress of their students during practical work sessions using Github.\nFrom the monitoring over time of student commits to the completion rate of each question by the TP group, as well as the distribution of the types of commits of each student (before / after a correction...), the teacher has access to several tools to best support his students during the practical work sessions.\nFeatures\n\nDisplay commits of multiple repositories on a single view\nFilter commits by TP group or by resolved question\nAdd markers (session, review, correction) and see when associated questions have been resolved in relation to these markers using colored indicators\n\nHave an overview of the students' work habits\nGo back in time to a specific date\n\nSee the completion ratio in the group for each question.\nGo back in time to a specific date\n\nEasily view and add user accessible repositories\nExport of statistics on commits\n\nContribute\nIf you want to contribute to the project, please feel free to send us a message here\nKnown issues\n\nIf you want to access an organization's repositories but forgot to grant rights the first time you log in, you will not be able to use these repositories in the application. We are investigating the possibility to handle this in the application, but for the time being you need to log out of Git4School, revoke the OAuth key manually in your Github account, and then, when you log back in to Git4School, you can grant rights for the organization of your choice\nIf you need help, here is the Github documentation\n\n\nThere is currently a limit of 100 commits fetched per repository. This is the Github limit per request. \nWe don't plan to work around this limit until the need exists\n\n\nCommits are fetched only from the default branch. By default, since October 2020, the default branch is the main branch, master before that\n\nLinks\n\nUser documentation : this is where you need to go to if you want to get started with the application \nTechnical documentation : if you want to add your contribution to the project, it is strongly recommended to go through this link.

can find his way around.\n\napp\nThis is here that you will spend most of your time coding. It contains most of the source code within 4 sub-folders :\n\ncomponents\nguards\nmodels\nservices\n\ncomponents\nThis folder contains all the components of the application. If you want to add a new page or develop a new feature on an existing page, it is in this folder that you will need to place the new components.\n\nIf you want to add or modify a graph, everything is in the folder components/graphs.\n\nTo create a new component, execute ng g component components/.\nguards\nThis folder contains the guards as used in Angular. These guards are services that can be used to authorize access to a route or the leaving of a page.\nIn this way, we use 3 guards :\n\nauth.guard.ts: which ensures that the user is authenticated before allowing access to a protected route\ndata-provided.guard.ts: which ensures that valid and minimal data are loaded to ensure the proper functioning of the application. For example, if no valid configuration file is provided in the /overview page, it is not possible to access /questions-completion or /edit-metadata\ndata-loading.guard.ts: which authorizes the leaving of a page if the associated component is not loading. This guard is used in the /overview page to prevent the user from leaving the page if the processing of repository data is in progress\n\nIf you want to create a new guard, do the following :\n\nexecute ng g guard .\\guards\\\nselect interface(s) to implement\nadd the guard to route(s) in src/app/app-routing.module.ts{\n    path: 'myPath',\n    component: MyComponent,\n    canActivate: [AuthGuard, MyGuard],\n    canDeactivate: [DataLoadingGuard]\n}\n\nmodels\nThis folder contains all the models of the application. These are classes that can be instantiated to facilitate data management in the application. We have 6 fairly explicit model classes :\n\nAssignment : this is a collection of repositories, milestones, sessions and metadata (start date, end date, course ...)\nMetadata\nCommit\nMilestone (review, correction, other)\nRepository\nSession\n\nTo create a new model, execute ng g class models/ --type=model.\nservices\nThis folder contains the application services. The services allow to perform operations that can be common to several components in the application.\nLet's detail the 4 services we use:\n\nauth.service.ts : which allows to manage the user authentication to Github.\ndata.service.ts : which allows to store the data to be shared between the components. It is thanks to it that the user can navigate in the application without having to enter the configuration file each time he changes pages.\njson-manager.service.ts : which allows to manage the configuration file (upload/download/verification)\ncommits.service.ts : which allows to manage the retrieval of data from Github repositories, as well as the generation of statistical data (used for downloading and for displaying graphs /students-commits and /questions-completion)\n\nTo create a new service, execute ng g service services/.\nThen use it in component or a service by declaring it in the constructor :\nconstructor(\n    private commitsService: CommitsService,\n    public myService: MyService\n) {}\nNote that if you want to use a service in a HTML file, you have to declare the service as public !\n\nassets\nThis folder contains useful resources for the application.\nadditional docs\nThis folder contains useful resources for generating additional documentation such as this page.\nIf you want to add a page to the documentation, create a file .md and update the summary.json file by adding an element as following (see this page) :\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Architecture details\",\n    \"file\": \"CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"My documentation\",\n    \"file\": \"myDoc.md\"\n  }\n]i18n\nThis folder is very important because it manages the localization of the application. It contains the json files corresponding to the possible localizations of the application. For the moment there are only 2 files:\n\nen.json\nfr.json\n\nIf you want to add a localization, create a file .json and update the file src/app/app.component.ts :\nconstructor(\n    public authService: AuthService,\n    public dataService: DataService,\n    private router: Router,\n    public translate: TranslateService\n) {\n    translate.addLangs(['en', 'fr', 'myLocalizattion']);\n    translate.setDefaultLang('en');\n}In this new file you must translate every variable contained in the other files. Which means that there must be the same variables in all localization files.\nTo make your life easier and avoid forgetting things, I advise you to use BabelEdit.\nimages\nThis folder contains images used in the application.\nThere are no special rules, you can reorganize the folder at your convenience if the content starts to grow a bit too much. If so, update the path of images used for the user guide in /home.\nYou can access these files with assets/images/.\ntech-docs\nThis folder should not be present because it is generated after a merge on master only and should never be pushed. However, it is in this folder that the technical documentation will be generated by serving it locally. This is very useful to see the changes made before pushing the code.\nTo serve the technical documentation locally, execute yarn run serve-tech-docs.\nuser documentation\nThis folder contains a collection of files, including markdown files which, once converted using Jekyll, will result in HTML files that constitute the user documentation. This conversion is done automatically after the merge on master thanks to Github Pages. \n\nPrerequisite : to serve the user documentation locally, Ruby and and Bundler must be installed and run bundle install.\n\nTo serve the user documentation locally, execute yarn run serve-user-docs.\nDetails of the existing files\n\ndocs/ : this folder contains all the markdown (.md) files that will constitute the user documentation. \nThe Jekyll theme we're using is Just the Docs, you can find more information on how navigation works according to file distribution here\n\n\n.gitignore : this file has the same function as the one present at the root of the project, but its scope is limited to the user documentation. In particular, it prevents the generated documentation from being pushed after serving it locally\n_config.yml : this where the options to configure Jekyll are set up\nGemfile : it's in this file that are indicated the Jekyll plugins to use, only when serving locally. When running bundle install, the Jekyll plugins indicated in this file are installed\nGemfile.lock : this file is used to install the same versions of Jekyll plugins from one machine to another and therefore facilitates collaborative work\nindex.md : this is the user documentation root, the home page\n\n\nFor more detailled information about the directory structure, you can read the Jekyll documentation.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
