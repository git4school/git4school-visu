project\nE-education is a field aiming to support teaching and learning using digital tools. It is more than ever in tune with the time and is becoming an important learning tool. In this context, Jean-Baptiste Raclet and Franck Sylvestre, teacher-researchers at IRIT, are working together on a programming learning protocol. Based on test-driven development, peer reviewing and iterative approach (testing, development, peer reviewing, testing, development, ...), the protocol uses digital tools such as Elaastic and Git4School. To understand the need behind Git4School, it is necessary to detail the \"development\" part of the protocol. In a practice session, a question sheet is given to the students. Then, they develop the features that validate the tests. At the end of each question, the student has to commit his code to his Github repository, with a message identifying the question. After a certain amount of sessions, the teacher will organize a peer review, and then later send the correction to the students. It is therefore important that the teacher is able to follow the progress of the group in order to make reviews and corrections neither too early nor too late. It is to avoid having to visit each repository to get an idea of the group's progression that this project was created.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nYou can find detailed documentation to get started here\n\nGit4School is an application that helps teachers follow the progress of their students during practical work sessions using Github.\nFrom the monitoring over time of student commits to the completion rate of each question by the TP group, as well as the distribution of the types of commits of each student (before / after a correction...), the teacher has access to several tools to best support his students during the practical work sessions.\nFeatures\n\nDisplay commits of multiple repositories on a single view\nFilter commits by TP group or by resolved question\nAdd markers (session, review, correction) and see when associated questions have been resolved in relation to these markers using colored indicators\n\nHave an overview of the students' work habits\nGo back in time to a specific date\n\nSee the completion ratio in the group for each question.\nGo back in time to a specific date\n\nEasily view and add user accessible repositories\nExport of statistics on commits\n\nContribute\nIf you want to contribute to the project, please feel free to send us a message here\nKnown issues\n\nIf you want to access an organization's repositories but forgot to grant rights the first time you log in, you will not be able to use these repositories in the application. We are investigating the possibility to handle this in the application, but for the time being you need to log out of Git4School, revoke the OAuth key manually in your Github account, and then, when you log back in to Git4School, you can grant rights for the organization of your choice\nIf you need help, here is the Github documentation\n\n\nThere is currently a limit of 100 commits fetched per repository. This is the Github limit per request. \nWe don't plan to work around this limit until the need exists\n\n\nCommits are fetched only from the default branch. By default, since October 2020, the default branch is the main branch, master before that\n\nLinks\n\nUser documentation : this is where you need to go to if you want to get started with the application \nTechnical documentation : if you want to add your contribution to the project, it is strongly recommended to go through this link.

can find his way around.\n\napp\nThis is here that you will spend most of your time coding. It contains most of the source code within 4 sub-folders :\n\ncomponents\nguards\nmodels\nservices\n\ncomponents\nThis folder contains all the components of the application. If you want to add a new page or develop a new feature on an existing page, it is in this folder that you will need to place the new components.\n\nIf you want to add or modify a graph, everything is in the folder components/graphs.\n\nTo create a new component, execute ng g component components/.\nguards\nThis folder contains the guards as used in Angular. These guards are services that can be used to authorize access to a route or the leaving of a page.\nIn this way, we use 3 guards :\n\nauth.guard.ts: which ensures that the user is authenticated before allowing access to a protected route\ndata-provided.guard.ts: which ensures that valid and minimal data are loaded to ensure the proper functioning of the application. For example, if no valid configuration file is provided in the /overview page, it is not possible to access /questions-completion or /edit-metadata\ndata-loading.guard.ts: which authorizes the leaving of a page if the associated component is not loading. This guard is used in the /overview page to prevent the user from leaving the page if the processing of repository data is in progress\n\nIf you want to create a new guard, do the following :\n\nexecute ng g guard .\\guards\\\nselect interface(s) to implement\nadd the guard to route(s) in src/app/app-routing.module.ts{\n    path: 'myPath',\n    component: MyComponent,\n    canActivate: [AuthGuard, MyGuard],\n    canDeactivate: [DataLoadingGuard]\n}\n\nmodels\nThis folder contains all the models of the application. These are classes that can be instantiated to facilitate data management in the application. We use 4 fairly explicit model classes :\n\nCommit\nMilestone (review, correction, other)\nRepository\nSession\n\nTo create a new model, execute ng g class models/ --type=model.\nservices\nThis folder contains the application services. The services allow to perform operations that can be common to several components in the application.\nLet's detail the 4 services we use:\n\nauth.service.ts : which allows to manage the user authentication to Github.\ndata.service.ts : which allows to store the data to be shared between the components. It is thanks to it that the user can navigate in the application without having to enter the configuration file each time he changes pages.\njson-manager.service.ts : which allows to manage the configuration file (upload/download/verification)\ncommits.service.ts : which allows to manage the retrieval of data from Github repositories, as well as the generation of statistical data (used for downloading and for displaying graphs /students-commits and /questions-completion)\n\nTo create a new service, execute ng g service services/.\nThen use it in component or a service by declaring it in the constructor :\nconstructor(\n    private commitsService: CommitsService,\n    public myService: MyService\n) {}\nNote that if you want to use a service in a HTML file, you have to declare the service as public !\n\nassets\nThis folder contains useful resources for the application.\nadditional docs\nThis folder contains useful resources for generating additional documentation such as this page.\nIf you want to add a page to the documentation, create a file .md and update the summary.json file by adding an element as following (see this page) :\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Architecture details\",\n    \"file\": \"CONTRIBUTING.md\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"My documentation\",\n    \"file\": \"myDoc.md\"\n  }\n]To build the documentation (into docs folder), execute npm run doc.\n\nWhen deploying a new version to firebase, run npm run build:doc and then firebase deploy.\n\ni18n\nThis folder is very important because it manages the localization of the application. It contains the json files corresponding to the possible localizations of the application. For the moment there are only 2 files:\n\nen.json\nfr.json\n\nIf you want to add a localization, create a file .json and update the file src/app/app.component.ts :\nconstructor(\n    public authService: AuthService,\n    public dataService: DataService,\n    private router: Router,\n    public translate: TranslateService\n) {\n    translate.addLangs(['en', 'fr', 'myLocalizattion']);\n    translate.setDefaultLang('en');\n}In this new file you must translate every variable contained in the other files. Which means that there must be the same variables in all localization files.\nTo make your life easier and avoid forgetting things, I advise you to use BabelEdit.\nimages\nThis folder contains images used in the application.\nThere are no special rules, you can reorganize the folder at your convenience if the content starts to grow a bit too much. If so, update the path of images used for the user guide in /home.\nYou can access these files with assets/images/.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
