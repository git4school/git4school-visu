## How to interact with milestones

It's possible to **add** a milestone by _clicking on the graph_ at the date you want to add it. This will open the window shown on the left below. 

To **edit** a milestone, simply _click on it_. This will open the window shown on the right below. It's also from this window that it is possible to **delete** the milestone by _clicking on the red button_.

- The **only mandatory field** to save a milestone is its **type** (radio buttons at the bottom).

- By default, the _work group_ associated with a milestone is `All`. This means that the milestone impacts the repository commits of **all groups**.

- The **order of the questions** is important to be able to tell what is the last question a student answered in the _[students commits graph]({% link docs/graphs/other-graphs.md %})_.

- The _label_ is not required. If none is provided, a label is generated when it's displayed in the graph.
