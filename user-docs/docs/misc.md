## Authentication

The connection is done with a _Github_ account.

The choice of the account is important because it's this one that will be used to search for repositories, so _only the private repositories to which this account has access will be visible_.

**For your first login**, you will be asked to confirm Git4School's access authorization to your Github account.

At this point you can also allow access to your organization's repositories by clicking on the `Grant` button.

_If you forgot to grant rights for an organization the first time you log in, you will have to **revoke the OAuth** key manually in your Github account and **log back in**, so you can grant rights for the organization of your choice._  
<small>If you need help, [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/reviewing-your-authorized-applications-oauth) is the Github documentation</small>

## Localization
